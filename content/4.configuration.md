## Setting up your config file

Make sure you have a valid config file set up. You can create a sample config by running:

```bash
nuch --config
```

This will put a default configuration file in your XDG config directory (usually `~/.config/nuch/config.toml`).

## Example config file

```toml [config.toml]
[working]
files = "Documents/writings"
images = "Documents/writings/images"

[[collection]]
name = "writing"
files = "your-site/content"
images = "your-site/public/images"

[[collection]]
name = "blogs"
files = "your-site/content/blogs"
# images omitted — optional
```

## Understanding the config file

> [IMPORTANT]{.text-primary .font-bold} :br
> [**All paths are relative to your home directory.**]{.text-lg}

Make sure to adjust the paths according to your project structure.

The working directories specified in the config file must contain valid Markdown files or images.
