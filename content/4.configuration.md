## Setting up your config file

Make sure you have a valid config file set up. You can create a sample config by running:

```bash
nuch --config
```

This will put a default configuration file in your XDG config directory (usually `~/.config/nuch/config.toml`).

```toml [config.toml]
working_dir = "Documents/writings"
publishing_dir = "your-site/content"
working_images_dir = "Documents/writings/images"
publishing_images_dir = "your-site/public/images"
```
> [IMPORTANT]{.text-primary .font-bold} :br
> [**All paths are relative to your home directory.**]{.text-lg}

Make sure to adjust the paths according to your project structure.

All directories specified in the config file must contain valid Markdown files or images.

## Directory explanations

### `working_dir`
Points to the directory where your **unpublished** Markdown files are located.

example: `Documents/writings`

### `publishing_dir`
Points to the directory that you defined as the content's **collection** in your `content.config.ts` file.

example: `your-site/content` or `your-site/content/blog`

### `working_images_dir`
Points to the directory where your **unpublished** images that are used in the post are located.

example: `Documents/writings/images`

### `publishing_images_dir`
Points to the directory where your images will be copied when publishing the post. This directory must be inside the `public/` directory of your site.

example: `your-site/public/images` or `your-site/public/blog-images`
