## Setting up your config file

The tool **requires a valid config file** to function properly.

Make sure you have a valid config file set up. You can create a sample config by running:

```bash
nuch --config
```

This will put a default configuration file in your XDG config directory (usually `~/.config/nuch/config.toml`) on Unix/Linux/macOS or LOCALAPPDATA (typically `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\nuch\config.toml`) on Windows.

## Example config file

```toml [config.toml]
[working]
files = "Documents/writings"
images = "Documents/writings/images"

[[collection]]
name = "writing"
files = "your-site/content"
images = "your-site/public/images"

[[collection]]
name = "blogs"
files = "your-site/content/blogs"
# images omitted — optional
```

::br

So if your `content.config.ts` file looks like this:

```ts [content.config.ts]
import { defineCollection, defineContentConfig } from '@nuxt/content'

export default defineContentConfig({
  collections: {
    content: defineCollection({
      type: 'page',
      source: '*.md',
    }),
    writing: defineCollection({
      type: 'page',
      source: 'writing/*.md',
    }),
  }
})
```

Then your config file should map the collections accordingly:

```toml [config.toml]
[working]
files = "where-ever/you-keep-your/writings"
images = "where-ever/you-keep-your/writings/images"

[[collection]]
name = "content"
files = "your-site/content"
images = "your-site/public/images"

[[collection]]
name = "writing"
files = "your-site/content/writing"
images = "your-site/public/writing-images"
```

## Understanding the config file

Make sure to adjust the paths according to your project structure.

The working directories specified in the config file must contain valid Markdown files or images.

#### Explaining the fields

### `working`
Points to where your **unpublished** files are located.

#### `files`
Points to the directory where your **unpublished** Markdown files are located.

example: `Documents/writings`

#### `images`
Points to the directory where your **unpublished** images that are used in the post are located.

### `collection`
You should define each collection corresponing to the content collections defined in your `content.config.ts` file. Each collection must have a unique name.

#### `name`

The name of the collection as defined in your `content.config.ts` file.

example: `content` or `blogs`

#### `files`

Points to the directory that you defined as the content's **collection** in your `content.config.ts` file.

example: `your-site/content` or `your-site/content/blog`

#### `images`

Points to the directory where your images will be copied when publishing the post. This directory must be inside the `public/` directory of your site.

example: `your-site/public/images` or `your-site/public/blog-images`
