## Basic Commands
NUCH provides a few simple commands to help you manage your Markdown content and associated images. The commands will expand as more features are added.

The current commands are:

### `nuch --config`

Generates a sample configuration file in your XDG config directory (usually `~/.config/nuch/config.toml`). You can use this file to set up your project structure.

### `nuch publish`

You'll be prompted to select a collection (if you have multiple defined in your config file). After selecting a collection, NUCH will look for unpublished Markdown files in your `working` files and allow you to select which one to publish.

Once selected, NUCH will copy the Markdown file to the corresponding `collection` defined in your config file. If there are any images associated with the Markdown file (i.e., images located in the `working` images directory), NUCH will also copy those images to the corresponding `collection` images directory.

### `nuch delete`

You will also be prompted to select a collection (if you have multiple defined in your config file).
Then, NUCH will give you a list of all published Markdown files in your `collection` files directory. You can select which one to delete, and NUCH will remove them from the collection directory, along with any associated images.

It will also prompt you to create a backup of the deleted files in your `working` files directory if there isn't already a copy there.
