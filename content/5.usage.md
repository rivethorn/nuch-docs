## Basic Commands
NUCH provides a few simple commands to help you manage your Nuxt Content files and associated images. The commands will expand as more features are added.

The current commands are:

### `nuch --config`

Generates a sample configuration file in your XDG config directory (usually `~/.config/nuch/config.toml`) on Unix/Linux/macOS or LOCALAPPDATA (typically `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\nuch\config.toml`) on Windows. You can use this file to set up your project structure.

### `nuch publish`

You'll be prompted to select a collection (if you have multiple defined in your config file). After selecting a collection, NUCH will look for unpublished Markdown files in your `working` files and allow you to select which one to publish.

Once selected, NUCH will copy the Markdown file to the corresponding `collection` defined in your config file. If there are images in your `working` images directory whose filenames start with the post’s stem, NUCH copies them to the `collection` images directory; if none are found it will now tell you.

### `nuch delete`

You will also be prompted to select a collection (if you have multiple defined in your config file).
Then, NUCH will give you a list of all published Markdown files in your `collection` files directory. You can select which one to delete, and NUCH will remove them from the collection directory, along with any associated images.

If the post is missing in your working directory, NUCH offers to back up the markdown (and any matching images) there before deletion so you can recover easily.
