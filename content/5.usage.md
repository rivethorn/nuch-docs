## Basic Commands
NUCH provides a few simple commands to help you manage your Markdown content and associated images. The commands will expand as more features are added.

The current commands are:

### `nuch --config`

Generates a sample configuration file in your XDG config directory (usually `~/.config/nuch/config.toml`). You can use this file to set up your project structure.

### `nuch publish`

Gives you a list of all unpublished Markdown files in your `working_dir`. You can select which one to publish, and NUCH will copy them to your `publishing_dir`, along with any associated images.

### `nuch delete`

Gives you a list of all published Markdown files in your `publishing_dir`. You can select which one to delete, and NUCH will remove them from the publishing directory, along with any associated images.
It will also prompt you to create a backup of the deleted files in your `working_dir` if there isn't already a copy there.
