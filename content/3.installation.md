cargo install nuch
```

### Unix Shell Script

You can install prebuilt binaries via shell script:

```

You can also download the binary from [Releases](https://github.com/rivethorn/nuch/releases/latest) page and add it to your PATH.

## Build from source

NUCH commands call `git add/commit/push`, so ensure `git` is available on your PATH.

You can also build NUCH from source. Make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Rust toolchain (cargo) 
- Git installed and on $PATH

Then follow these steps:

::steps
### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rivethorn/nuch.git
cd nuch
```

### Test the build:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Build and run NUCH:

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Run (shows help)
cargo run -- --help

# Create a sample config (writes to XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nuch/config.toml or ~/.config/nuch/config.toml)
cargo run -- --config
```

### (Optional) Install the binary to your PATH:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```
